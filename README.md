# Artwork_Captioning

This project aims to describe cultural works, through the image captioning. The main objective is not only to generate descriptive captions of a specific area, such as the cultural one, but the project also aims at understanding what are the logical mechanics that man applies in the description of specific images or photographs and how a neaural network can emulate its reasoning.

### Describe an Image

Describing an image is certainly not a simple thing and the task is even more difficult if the subject of the description is a work of art.
The purpose of this project is therefore relatively less demanding than a true description of an image. However, it will be essential to distinguish a statue from a painting, a man from a woman, a young man from an elderly person and it would be interesting to describe in as much detail as possible the gestures and clothes of the subjects, the background decorations and the emotions of the faces.

### Application
we have designed an application that takes a photograph and shows you a description of it. Its use is very simple as you can see from the images below:
